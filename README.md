# ðŸš¨ ice_tracker

A community-powered web app for reporting and mapping recent ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) activity. Built with Next.js, Firebase, and OpenAI moderation, this project helps keep communities informed and safe.

## Features

- **Submit Reports:** Anonymously report ICE sightings or activity at specific locations.
- **Live Map:** Recent reports are displayed on an interactive map (React Leaflet + OpenStreetMap).
- **Content Moderation:** AI-powered filtering prevents abusive or negative submissions.
- **Multilingual:** Supports multiple languages with instant language switching (next-intl) between English and Spanish.
- **Realtime Updates:** All reports and stats update live via Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Privacy First:** No user accounts or personal data required.

## How It Works

1. **Submit a Location:** Enter an address and (optionally) additional info about ICE activity.
2. **AI Moderation:** Submissions are checked for negative or abusive content.
3. **Geocoding:** Addresses are validated and mapped using Google Maps API.
4. **Live Display:** Approved reports appear instantly on the map and in the list.
5. **Stats:** The app tracks daily and weekly report counts.
